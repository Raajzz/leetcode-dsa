- The approaches provided in LeetCode solutions are potentially solutions where we're asked to build a string of `A + A` and then check `goal` in the combined `A + A` string.
- This works because, you're doing a right rotation, that means the leftmost elments will be the end of `A` and append the rotated part of the string to the beginning to construct the acutal string.
- Now, we basically have a problem of string search.
- Brute Force: O(N ^ 2) [T] | O(1) [S]
- Rolling Hash: O(N) [T] | O(N) [S]
- KMP: O(N) [T] | O(N) [S]

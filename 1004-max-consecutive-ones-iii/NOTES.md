- We'll be using a sliding window approach. Here, we'll be having a pointer to the beginning of the window and to the end of the window (denoted by `i`  and `j`) and we'll move this i and j according to different conditions.
- Initialize two pointers, start and end, both initially pointing to the beginning of the array.
- Iterate through the array using the end pointer while it's within the bounds of the array (end < nums.size()).
- Inside the loop:
- If the element at nums[end] is 0, decrement the value of k. This is because we want to keep track of the number of remaining flips we can perform.
- Check if k has become negative. If it has, it means we have used up all our available flips. In this case:
- Check if the element at nums[start] is 0. If it is, increment the value of k. This is because we're moving the sliding window and removing an element from the beginning, so if that element was a 0, we need to increment our available flips.
- Increment the start pointer to move the window one step to the right.
- Regardless of the above conditions, increment the end pointer to expand the sliding window.
- After the loop finishes, return end - start, which gives the length of the longest subarray with at most k flips.
- The logic behind this algorithm is to use a sliding window approach to maintain a subarray that contains at most k zeros. As the window expands, we decrease the count of k when encountering zeros. When k becomes negative, we move the window's starting position to the right while incrementing k if necessary. The maximum length of the subarray is tracked using the end - start difference.
